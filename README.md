# Zaynax Limited Weather App

This is a demo project for Zaynax Limited. The app showcases a weather application with a home screen displaying weather information for five pre-added cities. Users can add, update, or delete cities. Additionally, users can change the language in the app's drawer, which will affect the drawer and the logo on the home screen. The app also features a pull-to-refresh functionality to update the weather data.
